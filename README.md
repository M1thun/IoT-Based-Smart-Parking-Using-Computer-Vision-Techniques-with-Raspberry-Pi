# IoT-Based-Smart-Parking-Using-Computer-Vision-Techniques-with-Raspberry-Pi
The project describe an IoT based solution for monitoring of parking availability based on computer vision using Raspberry Pi. It allows us to detect and track cars in a parking lot. Parking Monitoring System tracks availability by analysing the image by detecting edges of cars using computer vision techniques by capturing images from raspberry pi controlled cameras in real-time. The system is developed to determine the number of slots and their location of parking places to inform the drivers. We provide a web application based interface for visualizing the status of each parking slot by recognizing a car in a parking lot and to define parking spaces as either reserved or available for parking.
